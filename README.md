Linear Interpolation: When the lights are dimmed, linear interpolation is used to dim the light values smoothly.

Sound Effect: A new sound effect is played when spotted by a gargoyle.

Particle Effect: A new particle effect is played when spotted by a gargoyle.

All of the above are triggered by walking into a gargoyle.
